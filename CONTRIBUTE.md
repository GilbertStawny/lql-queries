The community can create pull requests (PR) to improve existing queries or to add new ones. Please ensure each PR includes the following:

* A query that has been tested locally
* A text file that explains what the query does and a sample output
* A README.md if you are introducing a new category of queries, similar to K8s/README.md or K8s/Audit-Logs/README.md
